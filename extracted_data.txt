The Findings
Sleep is essential for physical recovery, memory consolidation, and
overall productivity.
The analysis compares three sleep categories: less than 6 hours, 6 to 9
hours, and more than 9 hours.
It examines how sleep duration relates to academic performance,
physical performance, and long term mortality in adolescents.
Sleep deprivation is common among high achieving students who
sacrifice rest for study, despite negative effects on learning and
memory.
Both insufficient and excessive sleep are linked to poorer physical and
mental performance and increased risk of all cause mortality.
Lets see how it affects life!

Large scale investigation involving over 1.3 million participants show that sleeping outside
the 7 to 8 hour range is associated with increased mortality risk.
Short sleep is also linked to higher mortality, with less than 7 hours associated with a 12%
increase in risk and less than 5 hours with a 28% increase, likely due to stress,
inflammation, cardiovascular strain, and impaired immune function, noting one outlier
population with conflicting results.
Oversleeping above 9 hours is also associated with increased mortality, with a relative
risk of 1.30, indicating a 30% higher risk of death, supporting a U shaped relationship
where both insufficient and excessive sleep are detrimental to long term health.

Academic
Optimal sleep duration is critical for cognitive
functions such as memory consolidation, problem-
solving, and sustained focus, directly correlating
the 7–8 hour sleep window with higher academic
performance and daily task efficiency.
Physical
 Mortality
Deviating from the recommended 7–8 hours of
sleep disrupts physical recovery, with short
sleep impairing immune function and metabolic
balance, while oversleeping often serves as an
indicator of underlying chronic health conditions.

Composition & Layout
In our website, the header and sidebar stay there as you scroll down the website. That was
decided so it would always be easy for the audience to have access to the side menu instead
of scrolling back and forth.
Majority of the body texts are on a round-cornered rectangle. That’s because it makes it
easier to differentiate different sections of text and paragraphs. So we might change the
colour of each rectangle to help the viewer easily tell apart the paragraphs for each section
or have some text or no text box and some text staright on top of the background.
We aim to include graphs that are bigger in size than the text pieces themselves to easily
convey the information and visually attract the reader. They will also be interactive to
further attract the reader’s attention. So the text besides graphs will always be minimal, just
a couple dotpoints.
We have also included the purple button at the bottom of some pages to help the reader
navigate throught the website.
Colouring
Black is the background colour for our whole website. We
chose this because if you were to think of a colour to
represent sleep, it would be black because sleeps happen
usually in the dark. So it fits the theme of our website.

This colour of blue makes an appearance in our website as the header and sidebar.
This blue is a very light colour so it  helps contrast against the black background.
This blue colour variation appears in our website as a text box for text/titles as well
as graphs. This  colour is a good contrast against the white text and also creates a
consistent theme with the other blue colour used.
This purple colour in our website mainly appears as the colour for the buttons that
helps users navigate through the website page. 
This colour was chosen because purple is good contrast among the other blue
colours that are on the website,
These 3
colours were
chosen
because when
you think of
sleep, you
associate it
with a sense
of calmness.

the decision
of choosing
these pastel

Typography
F o n t  # 1
Font #2
This font is called “Agandir” 
It will be the feature on our website
as the main font for body text. 
This text has a simple aesthetic and is
easy to read which is a reason why we
used it. We want to prioritise the
audience’s needs. We want a simple font
because as mentioned in the colours we
want a simple website aesthetic so this
font was perfect.
This font is called “Calistoga” 
It will beused as the heading font in our website. 
This font is a bit more cursive but still acts as a good
heading font since it’s still simple and a common style
font but easy to diffrentiate from the body text font.
Based on JMSS sleep data, we can see that students' daily energy scores follow an inverse-U
distribution, with the most optimal levels of sleep falling between 6 and 9 hours, with the most
optimal being at 8 hours,  and the least reported energy scores belonging to those with less than 6
hours of sleep. This is could be because sleep loss impairs your brain's emotional regulation, leading it
to react excessively to negative stimuli. The same can be said for excess amounts of sleep (more than
9 hours), where lethargy takes over and you wake up groggy and sluggish.
This graph analyses the physical health based on the average amount of physical activity per week in
the form of km travelled per week. 
We can see here that the most optimal amount of sleep for physical activity is 7-8 hours, with
anything more or anything less leading to a decrease in physical acitivity. KM travelled droped by
more than half in most cases of little or excess sleep. This could be due to the lack of energy recieved
from little sleep, or lack of time to travel with excess sleep.
This graph analyses the emotional stability of subjects with different hours of sleep. Again the most
most optimal range for emotional stability is 7-9 hours with the most optimal being around the 8 hour
mark. 
With proper sleep, your brains are able to properly process your memories and properly handle
stress, allowing you to work and focus a lot better than with little sleep.
Unsurprisingly, individuals who got little sleep reported to have a much higher caffeine consumption
than people with good-quality sleep. If we link caffeine consumption to tiredness, we can see that the
least tired people got 7-9 hours of sleep and consumed less than 2 cups of coffee per day. 
The people who got the least sleep also increased their caffeine intake, averaging 1.5 cups per day.
This could be due to the caffeine that they consumed keeping them awake for longer, which leads to a
higher amount of sleep to compensate. 
Studies also show that sleep is strongly correlated to all cause mortality, with lack of sleep and
excess sleep increasing your risk of all cause mortality by roughly ~50% than if you had a normal
sleep. 
The graph shows a strong U-shaped distribution, with 7-8 hours being ideal for not increasing your
chances of death. Sleeping <6 hours increases strain on your cardiovascular, metabolic, and immune
systems, decreasing their effectiveness at a detriment to your health. Furthermore, those with
greater than 9 hours of sleep are likely to suffer from fragmented sleep, which strongly decreases
their sleep quality, causing a higher amount of bad quality sleep, which leads back to the same issues
of lack of sleep does.

Academic performance was also analysed, with average productivity scores asked from students
with differing amount of sleep. We see an inverse-U shaped distribution, strongly linking better
productivity to 7-9 hours of sleep. Productivity decreases on either side of the graph, especially
having less than 6 hours of sleep. Signalling that the lack of sleep and rest significantly impacts the
brains ability to focus. We see the graph drop off after 9 hours as well, possibly due to having higher
amounts of sleep leading to students being late to classes, or not having enough time to study,
This summary table shows that less than 6 hours of sleep is linked to higher stress, poorer sleep
quality, a higher heart rate, higher obesity rates, and lower productivity. The 6-9 hour range is by far
the best range across mental, physical, and mortality health & productivity.
